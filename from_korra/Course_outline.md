1. **Introduction to Networking**

   - What is networking?
   - Why is networking essential in cloud computing?
   - Basic terminologies: IP addresses, protocols, routers, switches, etc.

2. **Network Layers and Protocols**

   - OSI model and its seven layers.
   - TCP/IP protocol suite.
   - Understanding how data flows through these layers.

3. **IP Addressing and Subnetting**

   - IPv4 vs. IPv6.
   - How to assign and manage IP addresses.
   - Subnetting and CIDR notation.

4. **Network Topologies**

   - Common network topologies: star, bus, ring, mesh.
   - Pros and cons of each topology.

5. **Routing and Switching**

   - How routers and switches work.
   - Routing tables and routing protocols (e.g., BGP, OSPF).
   - VLANs and their role in network segmentation.

6. **Network Security**

   - Firewalls, IDS/IPS.
   - VPNs (Virtual Private Networks).
   - Security best practices.

7. **Cloud Computing and Networking**

   - Understanding cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
   - How cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure) manage networking.
   - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Virtual Networks.

8. **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**

   - What is SDN?
   - SDN controllers and their role.
   - Benefits of SDN in cloud environments.

9. **Load Balancing and Content Delivery**

   - Load balancers and their purpose.
   - Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and their importance in cloud services.

10. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**

    - Network monitoring tools.
    - Common network issues and how to troubleshoot them.

11. **Practical Networking Exercises**
